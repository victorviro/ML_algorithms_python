It is the normalization of the covariance between the two variables to give an interpretable score. The result of the calculation, the correlation coefficient can be interpreted to understand the relationship. The coefficient returns a value between -1 and 1 that represents the limits of correlation from a full negative correlation to a full positive correlation. A value of 0 means no correlation. The value must be interpreted, where often a value below -0.5 or above 0.5 indicates a notable correlation, and a value below those values suggests a less notable correlation."

This test of relationship can also be used if there is a linear relationship between the variables but will have slightly less power. As with the Pearson correlation coefficient, the scores are between -1 and 1 for perfectly negatively correlated variables and perfectly positively correlated respectively. Instead of calculating the coefficient using covariance and standard deviations on the samples themselves, these statistics are calculated from the relative rank of values on each sample.
