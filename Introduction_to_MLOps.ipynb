While **software code is** relatively **static**, **data is always changing**, which means ML models are constantly learning and adapting. ML systems also differ from other software systems in the following ways:\n",
        "\n",
        " - *Team skills*: In an ML project, the team usually includes **data scientists**, who **focus on data analysis and model development, but they might not be experienced building production-class services**.\n",
        "\n",
        " - *Development*: **ML is experimental**. We should try different features, algorithms, and hyperparameters to find what works best for the problem. The challenge is **tracking the results**, and maintaining **reproducibility** while maximizing code reusability.\n",
        "\n",
        " - *Testing*: Testing an ML system is more involved than testing other software systems. **In addition to typical unit and integration tests, we need data validation, model evaluation, and model validation**.\n",
        "\n",
        " - *Deployment*: In ML systems, deployment isn't as simple as deploying an offline ML model as a prediction service. **ML systems can require to deploy a pipeline to automatically retrain and deploy the model**.\n",
        "\n",
        " - *Production*: **Model performance can decay in more ways than conventional software systems**. Therefore, we need to track summary statistics of our data and **monitor the online performance of our model** to send notifications or roll back when values deviate from our expectations.\n",

        "Continuous **performance monitoring and adjusting of ML models is essential**. However, MLOps really tips the scales as critical for risk mitigation when a team has a lot of operational models since it is difficult to have a global view of the states of these models without some standardization. \n",
        "\n",
        "Pushing ML models into production without MLOps infrastructure is risky for many reasons. First because **assessing the performance of a ML model can often only be done in the production environment** since prediction models are only as good as the data they are trained on, which means the **training data must be a good reflection of the data in the production environment**. If the production environment changes, then the model performance is likely to decrease rapidly. \n",
        "\n",
        "Another risk factor is that **ML model performance is often very sensitive to the production environment** it is running in, including the **versions of software** and **operating systems** they use. They are often built on a pile of open-source software (e.g., libraries, like Scikit-Learn, to Python to Linux), and having versions of this software in production that match those that the model was verified on is critically important. \n",
